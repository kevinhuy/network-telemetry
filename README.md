## Network Telemetry

Network telemetry tool based on ping RTT and tcp SYN, SYN/ACK RTT. Python is used to extract the RTT from ping and tcp probes, run against one or more server/application. Influxdb is used as backend database to store the probes results. Grafana is the frontend web application where the graphs are displayed.

Each probe, Influxdb and Grafana run in docker containers linked between each other.

The python code can be customized adding new functions that include new targets. Multithreading is used in order to run the probes in parallel and do not add delay between each function execution. Because of that, I suggest to do not run more than 5 threads at the same time (Max number thread = or < number of cores). Docker file are provided for each probe.

Influxdb container will mount the database storage under `$PWD/influxdb` and will use a custom config file copied from `$PWD/influxdb/config/influxdb.conf`. Logs for Influxdb are in part disabled and raised to `error` level. That was necessary due to log verbosity that fill the disk space in few days.

Grafana is exposed to 0.0.0.0:3000 and is the only container exposed to the network. The other container are linked each other with `--link` option passed on `docker run`. If you want install some plugin, you need to log into the container and install from there. In this case is suggested to mount and external volume where plugin can be saved as well as all dashboard settings. Once up and running, Influxdb has to be added as datasource to Grafan (screenshot below).

In order to make easier the deployment of the all stack, a bash script is provided. Make sure `deployment.sh` is executable using `chmod +x deployment.sh` command. To execute it `/bin/bash deployment.sh`
